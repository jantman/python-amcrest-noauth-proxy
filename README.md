# ABANDONED - python-amcrest-noauth-proxy

[![Project Status: Abandoned â€“ Initial development has started, but there has not yet been a stable, usable release; the project has been abandoned and the author(s) do not intend on continuing development.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/abandoned.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#abandoned)

Python/Flask reverse proxy server that removes HTTP Digest auth from Amcrest IP cameras. Docker image provided.

Developed for Python 3.6, Flask 1.0.2, gunicorn 19.8.1.

This works as a reverse proxy, handling HTTP Digest authentication on the user's behalf (authenticating to the IP camera) and providing (from the user/client perspective) completely unauthenticated access to the camera. I've tested it with the CGI API including snapshots **and mjpeg stream** and it works for all of them. It does _not_ work for the web UI itself or RSTP streams.

mjpeg performance is tolerable but not amazing, with a latency of up to 30 seconds in my tests. However, you should be able to both stream mjpeg and access other CGI commands concurrently.

Note that this proxy only supports one backend camera at a time; even with the gthread threaded worker, performance suffers considerably when I tested multiple camera support. If you have multiple cameras, just run multiple instances of this proxy on different ports.

## Status

This was just a proof-of-concept of mine. I'm not using it myself, and it's now abandoned.

## Running via Docker

As an example, to expose a camera running at 192.168.0.61 with credentials admin:password on port 8000 of your local machine:

```
docker run -it --rm --name cam-proxy \
    -e CAM_ADDR=192.168.0.61 \
    -e CAM_USER=admin \
    -e CAM_PASS=password \
    -p 8000:8080 jantman/python-amcrest-noauth-proxy
```

Then you should be able to point your browser to, say:

* http://127.0.0.1:8000/cgi-bin/snapshot.cgi
* http://127.0.0.1:8000/cgi-bin/mjpg/video.cgi?channel=1&subtype=1
* http://127.0.0.1:8000/cgi-bin/ptz.cgi?action=start&channel=1&code=Position&arg1=-3000&arg2=0&arg3=0

## Running Locally

Install the requirements in a virtualenv, then:

``gunicorn -c python:gunicorn_config amcrest_noauth_proxy:app``

Note that gunicorn's default "sync" worker type will completely block

## Building

``./docker-build.sh``
